DOCUMENT REVIEW FORM
Version 1.1

PURPOSE: This template is for use when conducting a document review.

USAGE:
1. A commit/merge request to the master branch is submitted for review to the
   CCB Librarian including a branch or a diff.
2. When an issue is Major+, the Librarian schedules a document review meeting
   with the CM Leader.
3. The CCB Librarian (adds line numbers and) distributes the document (with
   "_inspection" appended to the file name before the file extension), along
   with a suggested meeting time, to a minimum of 2 reviewers of his/her choice
   (who are not the commit/merge submitter), including the CM Leader.
4. Each reviewer inspects the changes, notes issues using the below review
   template (including the header), and makes a recommendation as to whether a
   meeting is necessary.  The reviewer appends their first name to the file name
   before the file extension.
5. Completed forms are submitted to the CM Leader 24 hours before the meeting.
