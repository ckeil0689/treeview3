TreeView is an open-source Java app for visualizing large data matrices. It can load a data matrix, cluster it, browse it, customize its appearance and export it (or parts of it) into a figure.

It was first developed by Michael Eisen in 1998 (Treeview 1.0) and updated a few years later by Alok Saldanha (Treeview 2.0). We have now completely redesigned the app and released a new & improved TreeView 3.0 that is faster, cleaner and easier to use.
