TREEVIEW 3.0
============

TreeView is an open-source Java app for visualizing large data matrices. It can load a dataset, cluster it, browse it, customize its appearance and export it (or parts of it) into a figure.

WHAT'S NEW
==========

## In Treeview 3.0 ##

* We have completely re-designed the interface to include one main data panel, with zooming, scrolling and searching options.
* We have made clustering an integral part of TreeView (no need for Cluster 3.0).
* We have added more flexible color settings (multiple colors, varying ranges) and label settings.
* We have eliminated some of the features that we considered obsolete or in need of a major re-work.
* We have improved image export.

## Since Alpha 2 ##

* New window layout that optimizes screen space
* Improved navigation:
    * whizzing labels and trees
    * double-click to zoom
* New data export:
    * copy labels to clipboard
