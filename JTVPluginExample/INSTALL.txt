To use this example, you need to have the following:

1) Apache Ant
2) Java Treeview, 1.1.0 or later, "bin" distribution

All you need to do is edit build.xml so that the 
treeview.home property contains the path to the
Java Treeview installation folder (i.e. the folder that
contains the TreeView.jar file)

Now, typing

ant install

should create an "DataTable.jar" file in the ${treeview.home}/plugins. 
The next time you start Java Treeview, the DataTable plugin should be installed.
(alternatively, go to Help->Plugins... and click on "scan for plugins")
