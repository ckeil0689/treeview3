	Compatible modifiers can be held in combination during an action.  The result effect may be either additive or not depending on context.

	*     Mutually exclusive.
	      All actions except nav-button clicks are assumed to be over content (matrix, labels, or trees)
	**    Alternate Navigation Modifiers.  Applies only to: scroll-move (without option) & main nav +/- buttons (with option).
	      Every other context when option is held utilizes the Default Function Modifiers.
	***   Small, medium, & large are analogous to slow, medium, & fast.
	      "Full" or "step-wise" means for example "zoom all the way" or "scroll by page".
	****  "Toggle" is relative to the first tile clicked only.  "Extend" and "shrink" apply to existing selections from the closest edge/corner.
	      E.g. if a tile clicked is unselected and the drag overlaps a selection, the previous selection remains selected.  Selections are added only.
	***** "Inspection" functions are for aiding in the visual association of data that is far apart by highlighting data.
	      It is only used for hover functions.  It can also be used to preview what will be selected after clicking.
	      The scroll wheel turns off the highlight.
