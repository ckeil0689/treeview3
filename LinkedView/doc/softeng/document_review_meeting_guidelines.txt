MEETING RULES

The following rules will be followed in the document review meeting:

1. It is not the purpose of the meeting to determine validity of issues
   presented by reviewers, thus issues are presented as-is without debate/
   discussion.
2. The developer may address feedback as they see fit after the meeting via
   document changes and a subsequent commit/merge request.
3. A reviewer may only ask a question to the developer for clarification of
   document content that they do not understand.  Issues arising from that
   understanding are addressed in the next document review meeting if
   necessary.
4. It's the CM Leader's responsibility to maintain the scope and pace of the
   meeting given the guidelines of this document using the following mechanisms:
	A. Beyond Meeting Scope - If interactions between meeting members strays
	   beyond the inspector conveying issues found during their review, or a
	   clarification of document content, the CM Leader may declare the
	   topic "beyond meeting scope" and either direct the reviewer to
	   advance to the next issue or re-orient the discussion back toward the
	   identification of the reviewer's interpretation of defects and ensure
	   that the defect pointed out is understood by the developer.
	B. Beyond Document Scope - If the CM Leader determines that the
	   discussion of an issue has gone beyond the scope or intent of the
	   document (e.g. relates to over-arching project design, principles, or
	   coding conventions), the CM Leader may declare the topic "beyond
	   meeting scope" and either direct the reviewer to advance to the next
	   issue or re-orient the discussion back toward the identification of
	   the reviewer's interpretation of defects and ensure that the defect
	   pointed out is understood by the developer.
	C. Time - If the CM Leader determines that a discussion, while
	   productive, may be more effectively/efficiently addressed outside of
	   the meeting, he/she may suggest that the topic be discussed after the
	   meeting and direct the reviewer to advance to the next issue.

BEFORE THE MEETING

Refer to section 3.2.4.2.2.1 INDEPENDENT DOCUMENT REVIEWS of the SCMP[2].

MEETING STRUCTURE

In turn, each issue marked as major or higher severity is stated aloud.  Lower
severity issues may be included at the discretion of the attendees.  The
developer is given the opportunity to ask for clarifications of the nature of
any issue or its suggested change.  The developer may respond to reviewers'
issues that are marked as questions to clarify document elements.  Note, the
purpose of all review meeting discussions is not to determine *how* to resolve
an issue, but rather to define what an issue is.  The meeting ends once all
major and higher severity issues have been discussed.

ISSUE RESOLUTION

Refer to section 3.2.4.2.2.2.5 ISSUE RESOLUTION of the SCMP[2].
