## WELCOME

TreeView is a software for visualizing clustergrams. It was first released in
1998 by Michael Eisen and then, a few years later, by Alok Saldanha, who
developed an open source version Java TreeView .

Despite its popularity (~1,900 downloads/month on average), Java Treeview has
not been updated in almost a decade and has collected many bug reports and
feature requests. We are now working on addressing these issues and releasing a
new version of Java TreeView that will be faster, cleaner and easier to use.

Current users of Java TreeView! How are you, gentlepeople? We need your help. We
need to know which software features you use and which ones are obsolete. We'd
like to hear your requests, comments, suggestions and complaints.

If you are interested in providing feedback, or would like to request to be
added to our pre-release testers email list, please contact us at
treeview@princeton.edu. We will send you updates and ask for your opinion in
occasional brief surveys. We will also let you know of early software releases
for which you can become a beta-tester, if you are interested.

## INSTALL

TreeView3 can be downloaded from:

http://www.princeton.edu/~abarysh/treeview/15-06-02/tv3_alpha02_final.jar
