/**
 * Interface to access header info about genes or arrays or treenodes
 * This interface is used many ways. The basic idea is that the "Header" refers
 * to which gene, array, or node you want information about, whereas the "Name"
 * is which header you want. Thus, getNumHeaders() is the number of genes,
 * whereas getNumNames() is the number of headers for each gene.
 *
 * Conceptually, the objects that are annotated (genes, arrays, nodes) can be
 * thought of as rows, and the various names as the headers of columns of 
 * information about them.
 * For historical reasons, the actual annotations are called the headers, 
 * and the column headers are called names (i.e. names of the annotation). 
 * This is because the first HeaderInfo objects represented subtables 
 * of the CDT file.
