/**
 * The idea here is that objects which implement this interface can have their
 * progress depicted by a progress bar.
 *
 * Typically, classes that implement this interface will use a LoadProgress2
 * instance to actually display their progress, and will manage the "phases"
 * portion of their behavior. However, they will pass off a pointer to
 * themselves, cast to ProgressTrackable, to various routines within the phase
 * that will then update the within-phase scrollbar.
 *
 * The purpose of this interface is to allow these slow running subroutines to
 * communicate back to the object that manages the phases of the long running
 * task, which in turn manages the LoadProgress instance.
