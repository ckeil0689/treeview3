<H3>Macintosh Screen Capture</H3>
<PRE>
In the Mac OS, use the Command-SHIFT-3 key sequence to save a picture of
the screen. A pict file of the image will be saved to the top level of the
system disk.

Later versions of the Mac OS let you capture rectangular portions of the
screen using Command-SHIFT-4. If you leave the CAPSLOCK on during this key
sequence, you can then just click on a window to capture that window. 

Holding down the control key for any of these key sequences allows you to
save to the clipboard rather than to a file on your Mac.
