:name:Dynamic View Allocation
:desc:Panels should be dynamically allocated, so that other panels can
dynamically expand to fill the extra space, and thus make better use of available screen real estate. This can most easily be
achieved by having the Views allocate themselves dynamically, and
having the MainView arrange them at load time. This would also result in
faster startup time, as the view currently are allocated at start
time, not load time.

:name:Intelligent Scrolling
:desc:Currently, redraws everything when scrolling. It would be nice
to shift up the previously drawn stuff by the right amount, and just
fill in the new stuff. I don't think this is very easy to do, though.

:name:Annotation Options
:desc:Similar to the Url Options menu item, allow users to customize
the gene/array annotation. Currently, would allow users to not display
CLID or UID. In the future, could specify which columns/rows of
annotation are displayed, and how.

:name:Ignore blank lines in input files
:desc:Blank lines are sometimes introduced when switching file
systems. Blank lines are always meaningless to treeview. Therefore,
they will be ignored.
