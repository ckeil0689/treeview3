:name:Dynamic View Allocation
:desc:Panels should be dynamically allocated, so that other panels can
dynamically expand to fill the extra space. This can most easily be
achieved by having the Views allocate themselves dynamically, and
having the MainView arrange them at load time. This would result in
faster startup time, as the view currently are allocated at start
time, not load time.

:name:Panel Layout Redesign
:desc:I don't like the way that the resizing works right now. There
should be more separation between the global side and zoom side. There
is no logical reason why the global view and the zoom view should be
the same height. Eisen doesn't require this, and I shouldn't. My
solution is to simply allocate two independant frames, one for the
global and one for the zoom. The subdivisions in these frames can then
be resized independant of each other, and moving the center divide
will cause a resize of all subcomponents of both views.
