These perl scripts may be of use to people massaging data for use with java treeview. The use of many of them is described in the examples section,

http://jtreeview.sourceforge.net/examples/index.html

SCRIPTS:

	aln2cdt.pl - converts clustal alignment to cdt format
	appendPcl.pl - appends data/annotations from a pcl to a cdt
	splitFasta.pl - extracts a set of genes from a large fasta file
	colorByThreshold.pl - colors in dendrogram using a threshold (i.e. correlation cutoff)


NOTES:

Some depend upon the Bio::TreeIO package found in bioperl,

http://bioperl.org/

and/or the PCL_Analysis package available from

http://pcl-analysis.sourceforge.net/

Either download and install everything, or just try and run them, and the dependencies should become obvious. See INSTALL for some advice.
