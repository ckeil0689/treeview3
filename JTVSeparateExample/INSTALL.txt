To use this example, you need to have the following:

1) Apache Ant
2) Java Treeview, 1.1.0 or later, "bin" distribution

All you need to do is edit build.xml so that the 
treeview.home property contains the path to the
Java Treeview installation folder (i.e. the folder that
contains the TreeView.jar file)

Then, just type

	ant run

at the command line.
